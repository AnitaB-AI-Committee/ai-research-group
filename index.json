This is what fueled my passion to pursue Biomedical Engineering, and continues to do so to this day. As a proud woman engineer in the tech field, I strive to encourage, motivate and inspire fellow women to join the industry. In this regard, the Grace Hopper tech conference is one such platform that I derive my inspiration from, with the constant exchange of ideas and stimulation amongst women providing an invaluable impetus to my drive. My strong adherence to diversity and inclusion in the workplace has also led me to being a part of three organizations that focus on supporting and helping underrepresented groups.\nDuring my free time, I love doing escape rooms. I feel they challenge you and always push you to do your best while being fun at the same time. I also paint, and love being outdoors and playing sports, tennis being my favorite. I also love travelling and have been fortunate enough to get the opportunity to travel to multiple countries across three different continents, and I expect that number to only grow!.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d28f7edb55f605afd00bb364270de08f","permalink":"https://anitab-ai.org/author/mounika-vanka/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/mounika-vanka/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Biomedical Engineer by profession and graduated from Duke in 2018.
