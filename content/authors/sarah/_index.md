Currently focusing on Engineering leadership/executive or founding member roles only and open to relocation

I am passionate about developing innovative products/solutions, bringing technology to the masses in a meaningful manner. As a leader, I believe in identifying the talent, nurturing it and bringing the best out of people. A breadth of experience in engineering leadership, artificial intelligence, entrepreneurship, software development, technology consulting, R&D spanning from Supply chain, retail, banking, healthcare, and video-gaming industry. 

Orchestrated an organization-wide transformational change that sets the companyâ€™s product vision, strategy, and distributed development of an AI-based self-service platform developed by a cross-functional global team of size 21 spread across 4 main divisions in the company aka digital, marketing, site merchandising, guest experiences, data sciences. Managed and coached global teams of software engineers and data scientists in North America, Asia Pacific, and the EU regions. Cofounded a startup in the video analytics and developed a B2B app with a 50 people team, delivering a dual business value at the intersection of inspiring ways to discover new products from trusted network and providing low cost, high converting value to content creators in an industry with a market size of $16.4 billion in 2022. I have worked on several cross-functional initiatives like operationalizing the online subscription service for meal kits with $112 million in sales. Led a process enhancement initiative to simplify the process of retail peak season preparation resulting in significant reduction in overall cycle time for each of those applications during disaster recovery process.
