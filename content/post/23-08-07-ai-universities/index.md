- [Fundamentals of Deep Learning: Designing Next-Generation Machine Intelligence Algorithms (2nd Edition) by Nithin Buduma, Nikhil Buduma, and Joe Papa](https://a.co/d/2wj4C18)

    #### Summary
    This book is designed for Python-proficient programmers, software engineering professionals, and computer science majors. It describes the intuition behind machine learning and deep learning breakthroughs without technical jargon. Readers will learn how to reimplement these breakthroughs independently and understand them at a level that rivals top developers in the field.

    #### Authors
    - Nithin Buduma, one of the first machine learning engineers at XY.ai.
    - Nikhil Buduma, co-founder and chief scientist of Remedy, a San Francisco-based company.
    - Joe Papa, founder of INSPIRD.ai with over 25 years of experience in research & development.

- [Learning Deep Learning: Theory and Practice of Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Transformers Using TensorFlow (1st Edition) by Magnus Ekman](https://a.co/d/1cowdch)

    #### Summary
    A complete guide to deep learning (DL) that elucidates both the core concepts and the hands-on programming techniques needed for success. Ideal for developers, data scientists, analysts, and others--including those with no prior machine learning or statistics experience. The author provides concise, well-annotated code examples using TensorFlow with Keras, covering the two dominating Python libraries for DL used in industry and academia.
